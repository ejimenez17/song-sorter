<h2> What is Song Sorter? </h2>

If you’re like me, you have a really hard time picking favorites. Favorite food, movie, book, song, artist... you name it. I’m going to try to solve at least one of these predicaments with the Song Sorter. This web app will help you figure out your current favorite tracks by any artist on Spotify. There are other Spotify API web apps out there that show your most listened to tracks of late, and while this can be a useful heuristic, our music preferences are always changing. Just because you listened to a song a lot 2 months ago, that doesn’t mean you still love it as much.

The Song Sorter will take the name of an artist you love, pull their discography from Spotify, and guide you through a process to rank their songs. All you have to do is make a series of choices between two songs: which one do you like more? If there's a song you don't like at all, you can remove it from your ranking. After you're done, Song Sorter will provide a list of all the artist's songs, ranked from most favorite to least favorite.

Does this sound like a lot to handle? Song Sorter will soon offer you other options for groups of songs to rank, if you don't want to go through an entire discography. Check out this repository's issues to see what is coming down the development pipeline.
